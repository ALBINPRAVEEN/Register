### Proper GitHub repository
You should follow [this](https://github.com/omxpro/register/tree/main/docs#forking-the-repo) to get your own fork of the repo If you don't already. You don't need to create a new branch, use the `main` branch for the commits. If you do use some other branch make sure to make a pr with that branch rather then using main.
