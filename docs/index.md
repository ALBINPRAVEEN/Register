# Welcome

Welcome to official documentation for is-a.dev. Here you will find multiple guides to make using your subdomain easier.

## Format

## Guides

- [GitHub Pages](github/index.md)
- [Hashnode Blogs](hashnode/index.md)
- [Railway](railway/index.md)
- [Other Services](other/index.md)

## Vercel and Netlify

You will encounter an SSL certificate issue when using Vercel and Netlify. Neither service will work with our domains. It is recommended to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or [Railway](https://railway.app) instead.
